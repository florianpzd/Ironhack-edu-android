Take a break between each question to answer the different questions from the students.  

Examples of questions:
- What is an emulator

#### :pencil2: Check for Understanding - Class activity/quick quiz

> :clock10: 10 min (+ 10 min Review)

**Activity 1**
Creation of a view containing some widgets previously seen:
- A **Textview** with Hello World and blue color at the top left of the screen
- An **Imageview** of size 150dp * 150dp with an imported image of their choice at the bottom right of the screen
- A **Button** that makes the whole size in length of the screen whatever the screen in the middle of the screen, with the text: click me

The notion of widget positioning should be found on the Internet but will be reviewed and deepened in **lesson 3**

### :pencil2: Practice on key concepts - Lab

> :clock10: 30 min

Creation of a view with the tool they prefer.
This view must contain:

- Three **Button** each 1/3 the length of the screen at the bottom of the screen (using the linear layout). These buttons must be of three different colors.
- An **ImageView** of size 200d * 200dp in the center of the screen
- A **TextView** below this image of size 18 sp. The text should be about three lines long but should not go beyond the right edge of the image, nor the left edge.
